# React Search Aggregator
Simple react app that uses Bing and/or Google APIs to search for terms. Did this app in two hours including tests. As it can be seen, styling is pretty basic but responsive. I used bootstrap 4 to save time and did almost nothing else in terms of styling. Also, I didn't implement pagination, it only shows the top items. Pagination could be implemented in an hour or so.

## Prerequisites
First, make sure you have valid Bing and Google credentials. Then, copy-rename Credentials.js.example as Credentials.js in /src/redux/bing and /src/redux/google. Also, make sure you have installed a package manager like NPM or yarn

## Running the project
If you're using npm, open a terminal and use this command 'npm run start'. If yarn is your package manager use the command 'yarn start'.

## Testing the project
Use the command 'npm run test' with NPM, or 'yarn test' with yarn.

## Additional notes
I hope you enjoy reading my code as much as I enjoyed writing it.
